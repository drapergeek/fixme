    % ./bin/setup

    % foreman start

[foreman]: http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/

Rails Task
----------

The `rake` command, will run all the specs in the project. You should make all
the specs pass.

There are currently 7 failing specs.

* `rspec spec/models/user_spec` will allow you to run a single spec. Just pass
  in the file as you see above


Front-end Task
--------------

Give the body light gray background.

Add a white navigation bar, which includes account information. It should span
the whole width of the background. Put the account information on the right
side.

Make the sign out link look like a button, with hover and active states.

Use a sans-serif font-stack for all text.

Change the "Create Article" button to look like a custom button instead of a
native form element. It should have rounded corners, a shadow, a blue
background, and hover and active states.

Horizontally center all of the main content on the articles index. Give it a
white background, a border, a shadow, and a little bit of vertical distance from
the navigation bar. It should be 500px wide, and have padding. All elements
should fit within the box you just made.
